PartExa - A Particle Library for the Exa-Scale
==============================================

PartExa is an open-source particle library written in C++ using state-of-the-art programming
techniques. PartExa strongly depends on the finite element library 
`deal.II <https://www.dealii.org/>`_ along with `p4est <https://www.p4est.org/>`_ for parallel 
distributed adaptive quadtrees and octrees. deal.II provides basic particle functionality with a
strong focus on efficient data structures and aspects of parallelization.
