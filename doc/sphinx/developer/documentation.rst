Documentation
-------------

Writing reliable documentation of a software project is an essential part in software development.
In this context, important aspects are amongst others to provide a getting started guide and
installation instructions, to give an overview of implemented feautures, and to cover source code
documentation. Hence, proper documentation improves the quality of a software project as it
facilitates development and maintability, and ensures transfer of knowledge amongst users and
developers. For this reason, within PartExa it is mandatory to write and keep documentation up to
date.

The documentation of PartExa is twofold:

* Installation and development guides are provided within a Sphinx-based documentation.
* Source code documentation is generated using Doxygen.

.. note::

   Recent precomiled versions of the `Sphinx <https://partexa.github.io/PartExa-Sphinx/>`_ and
   `Doxygen <https://partexa.github.io/PartExa-Doxygen/>`_ documentation are provided online.
